      <td><p>&quot;This anthology edited by Francesco Luti comes as the continuation of the
         discourse begun by Oreste Macr&igrave; in the sixties with Poesia spagnola del Novecento,
         and therefore constitutes a systematic review of Spanish-language poetry from the
         early fifties to our times, offering a full picture of poetic activity conducted in
         this delicate and fundamental historical period of the Iberian nation.<br />Most of
         the authors who appear in the anthology actively participated in the transition from
         the dictatorship to democracy, and several of these voices &ndash; departing from
         a vision of poetry as an in-depth and direct knowledge of reality &ndash; have over
         the years targeted the search for a new language in contrast with the dogmatism of
         the &laquo;social poetry&raquo; that had till then dominated the scene of the Francoist
         period.<br />The volume edited by Francesco Luti embraces several generations of poets,
         from the by now &quot;classics&quot; of the so-called &laquo;1950 generation&raquo;
         to the &laquo;novisimos&raquo;, followed by the &laquo;poets of experience&raquo;
         to finally include those who have come to light in the past twenty years, such as
         Luis Antonio de Villena, Benitez Reyes, Garcia Montero and Carlos Marzal.<br />As
         Giorgio Luti writes in his introduction, the Vallecchi publishing house, &laquo;which
         for a good part of the twentieth century had the merit of presenting and investigating
         the Italian dimension of the cultural debate, as well as always having had a watchful
         eye for the foreign novelties that appeared beyond our borders&raquo;, with this essay
         continues its great tradition, &laquo;in this case, setting it in an anthology that
         certifies a clear innovative climate, even in an intricate path that requires substantial
         overall newness of the whole experience that the second half of last century has brought
         forward, despite obstacles and contradictions&raquo;<a href="http://www.vallecchi.it/catalogo.aspx?p=p&amp;codice=VLCA-AP017poesia&amp;cat=2630&amp;lingua=1"></a></p><p><a

      <td><p><strong>Millepede. Behind Things Forgotten (Edizioni Polistampa, 2006)</strong></p><p>The
         story takes place across a period of around twenty years (1979-2001) between Florence,
         Brazil, Le Marche and Spain. The protagonist, Giovanni Alis, is a theatre loving young
         man in search of experience forced to struggle against the cynicism of society.He
         struggles, with life and mankind, to win the battle against ceding his autonomy. We
         accompany him on his travels with his friends, his brothers, his grandfather, and
         Alice. Millepede is at once a novel about growing up, an &#39;archive of nostalgia&#39;,
         and a love story. But it is also a stylish piece of prose, a catalogue of small events
         permeated by emotions, like in poem. The narrator&#39;s eye is capable of capturing
         unusual details. Millepede takes us back to a truer form of literature, expressed
         by a writer who still has much to left to say.</p><strong>&quot;An elegant portrait
         of changing seasons: from that of youth to that of maturity, written with a subtle
         humour which acts as a perfect counterweight to the melancholy from whence it comes.&quot;
         (Antonio Tabucchi).</strong>
